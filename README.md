# RGBSync

# This application is no longer being developed, Darth is working on a project called RGBSync+ (https://github.com/DarthAffe/RGBSyncPlus) which is much better than this, this was only made as a quick example and for my own use.

A ready to use application for syncing RGB.NET capable devices. it uses Aura as the master and mimics that to all other RGB.NET capable devices and Corsair Link Lighting Node Pro / Commander Pro.

PLEASE NOTE RGBSYNC DOES NOT WORK ON RYZEN BOARDS (ALL THE ONES TESTED ATLEAST) DUE TO THIS BUG - https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?97533-Calling-GetMBColor-returns-only-white

ANY RYZEN MOTHERBOARD BUG REPORTS STATING IT'S ONLY WHITE/BLACK WILL BE CLOSED.
